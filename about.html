                    The story begins with Nintendo previously trying its luck in the arcade game market. They achieved popularity in Japan with the Radar Scope game, but failed to gain traction in the United States. To solve this problem, Nintendo sent Shigeru Miyamoto, a young graphic designer, to create a new concept that could be reused in the Radar Scope game system.
                    Some time later, Miyamoto got inspired by the Popeye cartoon and created a new character and story, a carpenter who tries to save his girlfriend from being attacked by a giant gorilla, later known as Donkey Kong. After the concept of the character and story was formed, Miyamoto gave the main character the name 'Jumpman'.
